## About me
My name is Kristoffer Dalby, I was born in 1992, I am from Sandefjord and I am currently living in Madrid, Spain.

## Education
Currently, I am enrolled at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid as an exchange student in Computer Science. My home university is Norwegian University of Science and Technology where I study for a Master in Informatics.

## Voluenteer work
I like doing volunteer work.

During my higher education, I am active in dotkom (System development and administration committee), which is a part of the Student organization Online. In addition to dotkom, I was a part of the Excursion committee, planning the third year trip to Silicon Valley and I was a part of the committee responsible for the economy in three and a half year.

A big part of my time is used on throwing LAN Parties. I have compiled a list of my participation of LAN parties [here](https://kradalby.no/lan-resume.html).

## Code
I enjoy coding. I like to learn new languages, play with new technology, and toy with things like continuous integration and system administration.

I have projects in Swift, Erlang, Java, Python, Go, JavaScript and bash to name a few. I try to write good code, that can be reused and easily maintained.

## The blog
My main intention of this blog is to use the posts as documentation for my projects. I try to write the posts as helpful as possible, and I hope it will help people. If you find anything here useful or find things that do not work, please let me know.

Some of the documentation found here has also made it to the official documentation:
