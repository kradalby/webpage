summary: Creating a blog with pelican
---

Today I was sick and I found pelican.

Pelican is a static web page/blog generator written in python. This means that it is very safe, scalable and does not need anything special on the web server to run.

The point of this blog is using it to post stuff as documentation, and since that will probably don't happen I will not update it or post anything.
